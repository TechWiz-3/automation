# Docker Automation

Docker commands can be quite tedious, any automation is very helpful.  

[`Run Container`](./run_container)  
A very useful script that pulls the latest version from github and then builds and deploys it automatically  
Used in both my discord bot repos, copied from my resolution bot repo [here](https://github.com/TechWiz-3/newYearResolutionBot/blob/main/tools/run_container) and a lot of the early development pushed [here](https://github.com/TechWiz-3/railwayAppGDBot/blob/main/update_deploy)
