# Git commit emojis

We all like a bit of extra color and spice to our boring old commit messages, this not only adds that but also adds information *about* the commit.  

## The Story
So I noticed that [this](https://github.com/msaaddev) programmer's commits always had really neat looking labels with emojis. I searched it up and found a number of repositories or gists talking about emojis for various sorts of commits.  
However, I couldn't find ANY projects which automated the experience. Weird, right? Well no more, I made it for myself and at even one day old use it all the time myself.

Here are the emoji guides mentioned above:

The bash script compatible with UNIX based systems can be used as an alias for the basic git commit command. If you would like any extra features added please open an issue or PR.
