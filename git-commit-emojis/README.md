# Git commit emojis

We all like a bit of extra color and spice to our boring old commit messages, this not only adds that but also adds information *about* the commit.  

## The Story
So I noticed that [this](https://github.com/msaaddev) programmer's commits always had really neat looking labels with emojis. I searched it up and found a number of repositories or gists talking about emojis for various sorts of commits.  
However, I couldn't find ANY projects which automated the experience. Weird, right? [One](https://github.com/ahmadawais/Emoji-Log) project had a way to somewhat automate the experience by adding a function for each commit type. While this is a nice solution, I don't want to have to memorise the abbreviations/commands type of commit. Well no more, I made it for myself and at even one day old use it all the time myself.

Here are the emoji guides mentioned above:
