# Git commit emojis

We all like a bit of extra color and spice to our boring old commit messages, this not only adds that but also adds information *about* the commit.  

Inspired by msaadev's commit message and commit emojis  

The bash script compatible with UNIX based systems can be used as an alias for the basic git commit command. If you would like any extra features added please open an issue or PR.
