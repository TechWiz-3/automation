# automation
Automation scripts for personal use and learning  

Somewhat inspired by these [scripts](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts)  

Scripts are copied to `/usr/local/bin/` for accessibility in any directory  

[**`meetings`**](/meetings)  
Simple automated script that provides me with the MS Teams link for my classes based on the date and time.

[**`git automation`**](/git-automation)  
A slightly heavy handed but effective way of automating git commits for MacOS devices, equipped with voice assistance and some music at the end.

[**`download please`**](/download-please)  
Script that automates sending links for download to an email address.
