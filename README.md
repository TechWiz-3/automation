Automation scripts for personal use and learning  

Somewhat inspired by these [scripts](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts)  

Scripts are copied to `/usr/local/bin/` for accessibility in any directory  

[**`docker automation`**](/docker-automation/)  
Scripts that make my daily Docker work so much easier

[**`emails`**](/email)  
Scripts that automate sending emails for various purposes

[**`git automation`**](/git-automation)  
A slightly heavy handed but effective way of automating git commits for MacOS devices, equipped with voice assistance and some music at the end.

[**`gold prices`**](/gold-prices/)  
Script that displays current gold prices.  

[**`meetings`**](/meetings)  
Simple automated script that opens the MS Teams meeting and class work directory for my classes based on the date and time (I love this script lol).

[**`playlist player`**](/playlist-player/)  
CLI media playlist players in bash and python because I'm so tired of using iTunes or putting up with Spotify ads.

[**`port scanning`**](/port-scanning/)  
Python port scanner with some nice features (still in construction).  

[**`speech`**](/speech/)  
Speech recognition scripts. Hang around, one day it'll be a full voice recog, text to speech, AI machine learning assistant :D  

[**`startup jump`**](/startup-jump/)  
Simple script that uses bash menus to allow you to jump to one of four most-used directories.  

[**`stats`**](/stats/)  
Inspired by `neofetch` and `archey` back when I thought that neofetch was an Arch exclusive tool.
