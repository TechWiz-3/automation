Automation scripts for personal use and learning  

Somewhat inspired by these [scripts](https://github.com/NARKOZ/hacker-scripts)  

Scripts are copied to `/usr/local/bin/` for accessibility in any directory  

[**`emails`**](/email)  
Scripts that automate sending emails for various purposes

[**`git automation`**](/git-automation)  
A slightly heavy handed but effective way of automating git commits for MacOS devices, equipped with voice assistance and some music at the end.

[**`gold prices`**](/gold-prices/)  
Script that displays current gold prices.  

[**`meetings`**](/meetings)  
Simple automated script that provides me with the MS Teams link for my classes based on the date and time.

[**`port scanning`**](/port-scanning/)  
Python port scanner with some nice features (still in construction).  

[**`speech`**](/speech/)  
Speech recognition scripts. Hang around, one day it'll be a full voice recog, text to speech, AI machine learning assistant :D  

[**`startup jump`**](/startup-jump/)  
Simple script that uses bash menus to allow you to jump to one of four most-used directories.  

[**`stats`**](/stats/)  
Inspired by `neofetch` and `archey` back when I thought that neofetch was an Arch exclusive tool.
