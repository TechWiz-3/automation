# Git Automation

[**`simple.bash`**](./simple.bash)  
A slightly heavy handed but effective way of automating git commits for MacOS devices. Includes voice assistance and music :)  
Copied over from my bash scripts repo [here](https://github.com/TechWiz-3/bashScripts/tree/main/second_attempt)  
Planning on re-writing the whole script to be better written and more consistent with bash best practises
