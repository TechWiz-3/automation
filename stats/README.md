A bash script inspired by neofetch and archey-osx before I realised they weren't exclusive to Arch Linux.  

HUGE thank you to the archey-osx project, I have learnt and copied so much from this project, GIVE IT A STAR [here](https://github.com/obihann/archey-osx). 

Obsessed with how it looks in the different terminal themes I have lol
