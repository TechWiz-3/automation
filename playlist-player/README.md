# Playlist Player

A simple CLI python tool that allows you to play music from a folder in a playlist manner.  
No more spotify ads, no need for itunes, just a simple CLI interface to help you get what you want done as fast as possible and then be on with your work.

The bash version of the project has been abandoned for the time being.

## Please note

The python tools use a library called pytube, for some reason this library is no longer actively maintained and new issues pop up regularly, fortunately the community is still very active and all of the issues I've had have solution in the `Issues` section
